# MATH-130: Numerical Analysis Coursework

This repository contains my coursework for a Numerical Analysis course. It includes MATLAB scripts for key algorithms studied and developed throughout the course.

## Course Overview

Numerical Analysis involves the analysis and implementation of algorithms for approximating mathematical problems numerically. The course encompasses topics like computer arithmetic, solving nonlinear equations, interpolation, approximation theory, numerical differentiation and integration, and initial-value problems for ordinary differential equations. For more detailed information, please refer to the [UC Merced course catalog](https://catalog.ucmerced.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=16&coid=40702).

## Repository Contents

- `bisc_disc.m`: Implements the Bisection method for finding roots of a function.
- `divided_diff.m`: A script for calculating divided differences used in polynomial interpolation.
- `hw_4.m`: Homework file containing specific numerical methods applied to course-related problems.
- `numerical_differentiation.m`: Code for approximating the derivative of a function using numerical techniques.
- `precision.m`: Evaluates the precision of numerical computations under different MATLAB settings.

In addition to these files, the repository includes a folder named `snippets` which contains unorganized and random bits of code that were created during the learning process.
